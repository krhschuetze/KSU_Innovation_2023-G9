# KSU_Innovation_2023-G9
Project for Kennesaw State University's 'Innovation Hackathon 2023', GPC sponsor challenge

## Situation
One of the Hackathon's sponsors, GPC, challenged hackathon attendees to develop programs that would optimize the shipping process by eliminating empty space. 

## Task
The first component of our project was determining the Minimum Viable Product. As a group, we decided to emphasize functionality of base components, and build off of that. Therefore our MVP entailed calculating how many shippable items of a single size would fit into a single container type of fixed dimensions.

## Action
My main personal goal for this Hackathon was to create a deliverable in Python, so that's what I decided to write my calculating software in. I accomplished all goals relating to my MVP plan on the first day, including debugging.
The second day of the hack, I added the rest of the container types, as well as a way to track associated hazards and weight limits. I also looked into Flask as a way to integrate my teammate's Figma designs into the front end, but ultimately ran out of time to successfully learn the module. 
On the final day of the hack, I focused on presentation design along with my teammates, and presented to our sponsor's panel of judges.

## Result
Our program successfully counts how many of a given item will fit into a container, with four+ options of container dimensions. It also tracks progress towards a weight limit, and will warn the user of hazards associated with an item they would like to ship.
